## To compile Percolation.c
1. Download the fime ```compi_c``` by following the instruction here (in french):
  - ```http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/ens/Common/libMlv/install.php```
2. copy the file compi_c in the directory where Percolation.c is saved
3. run ```chmod +x compi_c ```
4. compile using ```./compi_c Percolation.c```

## To use the program

1. wait for the percolation lattice to be generated
2. chose the probability p of percolation using +0.01 or -0.01
3. press distrib to generate closed edges (gray) and open edges (blue)
4. press LAUCH to percolate from the top of the lattice
5. exit after pressing LAUNCH
